About the Task
Your objective is to recreate a fully functional, responsive, and dynamic copy of the homepage provided in the Figma link. The final output should closely match the design in terms of layout, interactions, and responsiveness.
Instructions
The homepage must be fully responsive across all screen sizes, including laptops smaller than 13 inches, laptops larger than 14 inches, tablets, and mobile devices. Since tablet and mobile versions are not explicitly provided in the design, you will need to use your best judgment to optimize the layout and user experience for these breakpoints.
All sizing, including fonts, paddings, margins, and layout dimensions, should be implemented using calc-based values to ensure fluid responsiveness. Fixed pixel-based layouts should be avoided.
You are required to use only frontend technologies, specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, or WordPress for the implementation. JavaScript is mandatory to achieve proper functionality. The homepage must not contain any static, hardcoded data such as paragraphs, images, or titles directly inside the components. Instead, all content should be dynamically rendered, either by fetching data from an API endpoint, a JSON file, or by consuming the WordPress REST API if applicable.
All features visible in the Figma design must be replicated, including sliders, carousels, navigation menus with scroll effects, hover animations, and any interactive transitions. Performance should be optimized for smooth loading and interactions, and best practices for responsive images and code structure must be followed.
When you complete the task, deploy the project on a hosting platform such as Netlify or Vercel and share the live hosted link. In addition, provide the full project source code as a compressed zip file via email. The source code must include clear comments that explain your approach and demonstrate best coding practices.
